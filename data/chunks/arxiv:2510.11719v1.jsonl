BayeSN-TD fits for\nmagnifications and time-delays across multiple images while marginalising over\nan achromatic, Gaussian process-based treatment of microlensing, to allow for\ntime-dependent deviations from a typical SN Ia SED caused by gravitational\nlensing by stars in the lensing system. BayeSN-TD is able to robustly infer\ntime delays and produce well-calibrated uncertainties, even when applied to\nsimulations based on a different SED model and incorporating chromatic\nmicrolensing, strongly validating its suitability for time-delay cosmography.\nWe then apply BayeSN-TD to publicly available photometry of the glSN Ia SN\nH0pe, inferring time delays between images BA and BC of $\\Delta\nT_{BA}=121.9^{+9.5}_{-7.5}$ days and $\\Delta T_{BC}=63.2^{+3.2}_{-3.3}$ days\nalong with absolute magnifications $\\beta$ for each image, $\\beta_A =\n2.38^{+0.72}_{-0.54}$, $\\beta_B=5.27^{+1.25}_{-1.02}$ and\n$\\beta_C=3.93^{+1.00}_{-0.75}$. Combining our constraints on time-delays and\nmagnifications with existing lens models of this system, we infer\n$H_0=69.3^{+12.6}_{-7.8}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, consistent with previous\nanalysis of this system; incorporating additional constraints based on\nspectroscopy yields $H_0=66.8^{+13.4}_{-5.4}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. While\nthis is not yet precise enough to draw a meaningful conclusion with regard to\nthe `Hubble tension', upcoming analysis of SN H0pe with more accurate\nphotometry enabled by template images, and other glSNe, will provide stronger\nconstraints on $H_0$; BayeSN-TD will be a valuable tool for these analyses."}
