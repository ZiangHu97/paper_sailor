In this paper, we instead argue that adversarial\nvulnerability can stem from efficient information encoding in neural networks.\nSpecifically, we show how superposition - where networks represent more\nfeatures than they have dimensions - creates arrangements of latent\nrepresentations that adversaries can exploit. We demonstrate that adversarial\nperturbations leverage interference between superposed features, making attack\npatterns predictable from feature arrangements. Our framework provides a\nmechanistic explanation for two known phenomena: adversarial attack\ntransferability between models with similar training regimes and class-specific\nvulnerability patterns. In synthetic settings with precisely controlled\nsuperposition, we establish that superposition suffices to create adversarial\nvulnerability. We then demonstrate that these findings persist in a ViT trained\non CIFAR-10. These findings reveal adversarial vulnerability can be a byproduct\nof networks' representational compression, rather than flaws in the learning\nprocess or non-robust inputs."}
