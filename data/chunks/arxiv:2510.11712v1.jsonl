For\nthe issues of maintaining geometric fidelity and photorealism in generation\nquality, we attribute the main reason to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,\nreal-world panoramic data, where such a data-centric view differs from prior\nmethods that focus on model design. Basically, DiT360 has several key modules\nfor inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation, applied at both\nthe pre-VAE image level and the post-VAE token level. At the image level, we\nincorporate cross-domain knowledge through perspective image guidance and\npanoramic refinement, which enhance perceptual quality while regularizing\ndiversity and photorealism. At the token level, hybrid supervision is applied\nacross multiple modules, which include circular padding for boundary\ncontinuity, yaw loss for rotational robustness, and cube loss for distortion\nawareness. Extensive experiments on text-to-panorama, inpainting, and\noutpainting tasks demonstrate that our method achieves better boundary\nconsistency and image fidelity across eleven quantitative metrics. Our code is\navailable at https://github.com/Insta360-Research-Team/DiT360."}
