However, enzyme turnover rates\nremain scarce across most organisms due to the high cost and complexity of\nexperimental measurements. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal\nframework for predicting the enzyme turnover rate by integrating enzyme\nsequences, substrate structures, and environmental factors. Our model combines\na pre-trained language model and a convolutional neural network to extract\nfeatures from protein sequences, while a graph neural network captures\ninformative representations from substrate molecules. An attention mechanism is\nincorporated to enhance interactions between enzyme and substrate\nrepresentations. Furthermore, we leverage symbolic regression via\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks to explicitly learn mathematical formulas that\ngovern the enzyme turnover rate, enabling interpretable and accurate\npredictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms\nboth traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. This work\nprovides a robust tool for studying enzyme kinetics and holds promise for\napplications in enzyme engineering, biotechnology, and industrial biocatalysis."}
