Foundation models in\nparticular have proven especially effective, enabling accurate training on\nsmall, real-world datasets. This study introduces CheMeleon, a novel molecular\nfoundation model pre-trained on deterministic molecular descriptors from the\nMordred package, leveraging a Directed Message-Passing Neural Network to\npredict these descriptors in a noise-free setting. Unlike conventional\napproaches relying on noisy experimental data or biased quantum mechanical\nsimulations, CheMeleon uses low-noise molecular descriptors to learn rich\nmolecular representations. Evaluated on 58 benchmark datasets from Polaris and\nMoleculeACE, CheMeleon achieves a win rate of 79% on Polaris tasks,\noutperforming baselines like Random Forest (46%), fastprop (39%), and Chemprop\n(36%), and a 97% win rate on MoleculeACE assays, surpassing Random Forest (63%)\nand other foundation models. However, it struggles to distinguish activity\ncliffs like many of the tested models. The t-SNE projection of CheMeleon's\nlearned representations demonstrates effective separation of chemical series,\nhighlighting its ability to capture structural nuances. These results\nunderscore the potential of descriptor-based pre-training for scalable and\neffective molecular property prediction, opening avenues for further\nexploration of descriptor sets and unlabeled datasets."}
