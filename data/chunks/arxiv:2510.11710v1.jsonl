In this work, Neural Quantum States are\nused to probe the strongly coupled and underdoped regime of the square-lattice\nHubbard model. We systematically compare the Hidden Fermion Determinant State\nand the Jastrow-Backflow ansatz, parametrized by a Vision Transformer, finding\nthat in practice, their accuracy is similar. We also test different\nsymmetrization strategies, finding that output averaging yields the lowest\nenergies, though it becomes costly for larger system sizes. On cylindrical\nsystems, we consistently observe filled stripes. On the torus, our calculations\ndisplay features consistent with a doped Mott insulator, including\nantiferromagnetic correlations and suppressed density fluctuations. Our results\ndemonstrate both the promise and current challenges of neural quantum states\nfor correlated fermions."}
