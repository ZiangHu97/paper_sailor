Current solutions have fundamental limitations: extending cutoff\nradii causes computational costs to scale cubically with distance;\nphysics-inspired kernels (e.g., Coulomb, dispersion) are often system-specific\nand lack generality; Fourier-space methods require careful tuning of multiple\nparameters (e.g., mesh size, k-space cutoff) with added computational overhead.\nWe introduce Multi-stage Clustered Global Modeling (MCGM), a lightweight,\nplug-and-play module that endows geometric GNNs with hierarchical global\ncontext through efficient clustering operations. MCGM builds a multi-resolution\nhierarchy of atomic clusters, distills global information via dynamic\nhierarchical clustering, and propagates this context back through learned\ntransformations, ultimately reinforcing atomic features via residual\nconnections. Seamlessly integrated into four diverse backbone architectures,\nMCGM reduces OE62 energy prediction error by an average of 26.2%. On AQM, MCGM\nachieves state-of-the-art accuracy (17.0 meV for energy, 4.9 meV/{\\AA} for\nforces) while using 20% fewer parameters than Neural P3M. Code will be made\navailable upon acceptance."}
