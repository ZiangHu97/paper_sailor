We state\na connection between sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and neural sequential\nsamplers trained by maximum-entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt RL), wherein\nlearnt sampling policies and value functions define proposal kernels and twist\nfunctions. Exploiting this connection, we introduce an off-policy RL training\nprocedure for the sampler that uses samples from SMC -- using the learnt\nsampler as a proposal -- as a behaviour policy that better explores the target\ndistribution. We describe techniques for stable joint training of proposals and\ntwist functions and an adaptive weight tempering scheme to reduce training\nsignal variance. Furthermore, building upon past attempts to use experience\nreplay to guide the training of neural samplers, we derive a way to combine\nhistorical samples with annealed importance sampling weights within a replay\nbuffer. On synthetic multi-modal targets (in both continuous and discrete\nspaces) and the Boltzmann distribution of alanine dipeptide conformations, we\ndemonstrate improvements in approximating the true distribution as well as\ntraining stability compared to both amortised and Monte Carlo methods."}
