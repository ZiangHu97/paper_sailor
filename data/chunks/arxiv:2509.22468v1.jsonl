While\nself-supervised pretraining on molecular graphs has shown promise, many\nexisting approaches either depend on hand-crafted augmentations or complex\ngenerative objectives, and often rely solely on 2D topology, leaving valuable\n3D structural information underutilized. To address this gap, we introduce\nC-FREE (Contrast-Free Representation learning on Ego-nets), a simple framework\nthat integrates 2D graphs with ensembles of 3D conformers. C-FREE learns\nmolecular representations by predicting subgraph embeddings from their\ncomplementary neighborhoods in the latent space, using fixed-radius ego-nets as\nmodeling units across different conformers. This design allows us to integrate\nboth geometric and topological information within a hybrid Graph Neural Network\n(GNN)-Transformer backbone, without negatives, positional encodings, or\nexpensive pre-processing. Pretraining on the GEOM dataset, which provides rich\n3D conformational diversity, C-FREE achieves state-of-the-art results on\nMoleculeNet, surpassing contrastive, generative, and other multimodal\nself-supervised methods. Fine-tuning across datasets with diverse sizes and\nmolecule types further demonstrates that pretraining transfers effectively to\nnew chemical domains, highlighting the importance of 3D-informed molecular\nrepresentations."}
