This approach has resulted in a myriad of methods and\nmodels in published literature across several categories of drug discovery\nresearch. This paper covers the research categories comprehensively with recent\npapers, namely molecular property prediction, including drug-target binding\naffinity prediction, drug-drug interaction study, microbiome interaction\nprediction, drug repositioning, retrosynthesis, and new drug design, and\nprovides guidance for future work on GNNs for drug discovery."}
