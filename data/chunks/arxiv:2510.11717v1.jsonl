{"id": "arxiv:2510.11717v1:summary", "paper_id": "arxiv:2510.11717v1", "section": "Summary", "page_from": 0, "page_to": 0, "text": "Event cameras offer various advantages for novel view rendering compared to\nsynchronously operating RGB cameras, and efficient event-based techniques\nsupporting rigid scenes have been recently demonstrated in the literature. In\nthe case of non-rigid objects, however, existing approaches additionally\nrequire sparse RGB inputs, which can be a substantial practical limitation; it\nremains unknown if similar models could be learned from event streams only.\nThis paper sheds light on this challenging open question and introduces Ev4DGS,\ni.e., the first approach for novel view rendering of non-rigidly deforming\nobjects in the explicit observation space (i.e., as RGB or greyscale images)\nfrom monocular event streams. Our method regresses a deformable 3D Gaussian\nSplatting representation through 1) a loss relating the outputs of the\nestimated model with the 2D event observation space, and 2) a coarse 3D\ndeformation model trained from binary masks generated from events. We perform\nexperimental comparisons on existing synthetic and newly recorded real datasets\nwith non-rigid objects. The results demonstrate the validity of Ev4DGS and its\nsuperior performance compared to multiple naive baselines that can be applied\nin our setting. We will release our models and the datasets used in the\nevaluation for research purposes; see the project webpage:\nhttps://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/Ev4DGS/."}
