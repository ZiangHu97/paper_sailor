While generally true for\nshort-term tasks, the \"frozen world\" assumption breaks down in modern reasoning\ntasks such as assistive programming, where models may take hours to think\nthrough problems and code may change dramatically from the time the model\nstarts thinking to the model's final output. In this work, we challenge the\nfrozen world assumption and evaluate LRM robustness under two realistic dynamic\nscenarios: interruptions, which test the quality of the model's partial outputs\non a limited budget, and dynamic context, which tests model adaptation to\nin-flight changes. Across mathematics and programming benchmarks that require\nlong-form reasoning, static evaluations consistently overestimate robustness:\neven state-of-the-art LRMs, which achieve high accuracy in static settings, can\nfail unpredictably when interrupted or exposed to changing context, with\nperformance dropping by up to 60% when updates are introduced late in the\nreasoning process. Our analysis further reveals several novel failure modes,\nincluding reasoning leakage, where models fold the reasoning into their final\nanswer when interrupted; panic, where under time pressure models abandon\nreasoning entirely and return incorrect answers; and self-doubt, where\nperformance degrades while incorporating updated information."}
