      "summary": "Drug recommendation is an essential task in machine learning-based clinical\ndecision support systems. However, the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI)\nbetween co-prescribed medications remains a significant challenge. Previous\nstudies have used graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent drug structures.\nRegardless, their simplified discrete forms cannot fully capture the molecular\nbinding affinity and reactivity. Therefore, we propose Multimodal DDI\nPrediction with Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) Maps (MMM), a\nnovel framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) quantum-chemical\ninformation into drug representation learning. It generates 3D electron density\nmaps using the ELF. To capture both therapeutic relevance and interaction\nrisks, MMM combines ELF-derived features that encode global electronic\nproperties with a bipartite graph encoder that models local substructure\ninteractions. This design enables learning complementary characteristics of\ndrug molecules. We evaluate MMM in the MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442\nsubstructures), comparing it with several baseline models. In particular, a\ncomparison with the GNN-based SafeDrug model demonstrates statistically\nsignificant improvements in the F1-score (p = 0.0387), Jaccard (p = 0.0112),\nand the DDI rate (p = 0.0386). These results demonstrate the potential of\nELF-based 3D representations to enhance prediction accuracy and support safer\ncombinatorial drug prescribing in clinical practice.",

While\nself-supervised pretraining on molecular graphs has shown promise, many\nexisting approaches either depend on hand-crafted augmentations or complex\ngenerative objectives, and often rely solely on 2D topology, leaving valuable\n3D structural information underutilized. To address this gap, we introduce\nC-FREE (Contrast-Free Representation learning on Ego-nets), a simple framework\nthat integrates 2D graphs with ensembles of 3D conformers. C-FREE learns\nmolecular representations by predicting subgraph embeddings from their\ncomplementary neighborhoods in the latent space, using fixed-radius ego-nets as\nmodeling units across different conformers. This design allows us to integrate\nboth geometric and topological information within a hybrid Graph Neural Network\n(GNN)-Transformer backbone, without negatives, positional encodings, or\nexpensive pre-processing. Pretraining on the GEOM dataset, which provides rich\n3D conformational diversity, C-FREE achieves state-of-the-art results on\nMoleculeNet, surpassing contrastive, generative, and other multimodal\nself-supervised methods. Fine-tuning across datasets with diverse sizes and\nmolecule types further demonstrates that pretraining transfers effectively to\nnew chemical domains, highlighting the importance of 3D-informed molecular\nrepresentations.",

      "summary": "We propose a machine learning (ML) architecture to better capture the\ndependency of thermodynamic properties on the independent states. When\npredicting state-dependent thermodynamic properties, ML models need to account\nfor both molecular structure and the thermodynamic state, described by\nindependent variables, typically temperature, pressure, and composition. Modern\nmolecular ML models typically include state information by adding it to\nmolecular fingerprint vectors or by embedding explicit (semi-empirical)\nthermodynamic relations. Here, we propose to rather split the information\nprocessing on the molecular structure and the dependency on states into two\nseparate network channels: a graph neural network and a multilayer perceptron,\nwhose output is combined by a dot product. We refer to our approach as\nDeepEOSNet, as this idea is based on the DeepONet architecture [Lu et al.\n(2021), Nat. Mach. Intell.]: instead of operators, we learn state dependencies,\nwith the possibility to predict equation of states (EOS). We investigate the\npredictive performance of DeepEOSNet by means of three case studies, which\ninclude the prediction of vapor pressure as a function of temperature, and\nmixture molar volume as a function of composition, temperature, and pressure.\nOur results show superior performance of DeepEOSNet for predicting vapor\npressure and comparable performance for predicting mixture molar volume\ncompared to state-of-research graph-based thermodynamic prediction models from\nour earlier works. In fact, we see large potential of DeepEOSNet in cases where\ndata is sparse in the state domain and the output function is structurally\nsimilar across different molecules. The concept of DeepEOSNet can easily be\ntransferred to other ML architectures in molecular context, and thus provides a\nviable option for property prediction.",

The\nkey is to treat each agent as relative to its surrounding agents in an\nenvironment that is presumed to change dynamically. Hence, in each time step,\nan agent is the centre of its own neighbourhood and also a neighbour to many\nother agents. Each role is formulated as a sub-graph, and each sub-graph is\nused as a training sample. A message-passing neural network supports full-scale\nvertex and edge interaction within a local neighbourhood, while a parameter\ngoverning the depth of the sub-graphs eases the training burden. During\ntesting, an agent's actions are locally ensembled across all the sub-graphs\nthat contain it, resulting in robust decisions. Where other approaches struggle\nto manage 50 agents, Q-MARL can easily marshal thousands.

In previous research, directed message passing neural\nnetworks (D-MPNN) have successfully been used to predict solvation free\nenergies and enthalpies in organic solvents. However, solvent mixtures provide\ngreater flexibility for optimizing solvent interactions than monosolvents. This\nwork aims to extend our previous models to mixtures. To handle mixtures in a\npermutation invariant manner we propose a pooling function; MolPool. With this\npooling function, the machine learning models can learn and predict properties\nfor an arbitrary number of molecules. The novel SolProp-mix software that\napplies MolPool to D-MPNN was compared to state-of-the-art architectures for\npredicting mixture properties and validated with our new database of COSMOtherm\ncalculations; BinarySolv-QM. To improve predictions towards experimental\naccuracy, the network was then fine-tuned on experimental data in monosolvents.\nTo demonstrate the benefit of this transfer learning methodology, experimental\ndatasets of solvation free energies in binary (BinarySolv-Exp) and ternary\n(TernarySolv-Exp) solvent mixtures were compiled from data on vapor-liquid\nequilibria and activity coefficients. The neural network performed better than\nCOSMOtherm calculations with an MAE of 0.25 kcal/mol and an RMSE of 0.37\nkcal/mol for non-aqueous mixed solvents. Additionally, the ability to capture\ntrends for a varying mixture composition was validated successfully. Our\nmodel's ability to accurately predict mixture properties from the combination\nof in silico data and pure component experimental data is promising given the\nscarcity of experimental data for mixtures in many fields.",

      "summary": "In this work, we propose a simple transformer-based baseline for multimodal\nmolecular representation learning, integrating three distinct modalities:\nSMILES strings, 2D graph representations, and 3D conformers of molecules. A key\naspect of our approach is the aggregation of 3D conformers, allowing the model\nto account for the fact that molecules can adopt multiple conformations-an\nimportant factor for accurate molecular representation. The tokens for each\nmodality are extracted using modality-specific encoders: a transformer for\nSMILES strings, a message-passing neural network for 2D graphs, and an\nequivariant neural network for 3D conformers. The flexibility and modularity of\nthis framework enable easy adaptation and replacement of these encoders, making\nthe model highly versatile for different molecular tasks. The extracted tokens\nare then combined into a unified multimodal sequence, which is processed by a\ndownstream transformer for prediction tasks. To efficiently scale our model for\nlarge multimodal datasets, we utilize Flash Attention 2 and bfloat16 precision.\nDespite its simplicity, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across\nmultiple datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness as a strong baseline for\nmultimodal molecular representation learning.",

However, earlier studies have focused primarily on obtaining\nnormalized IR spectra, which limits their potential for a comprehensive\nanalysis of molecular behavior in the IR range. For instance, to fully\nunderstand and predict the optical properties, such as the transparency\ncharacteristics, it is necessary to predict the molar absorptivity IR spectra\ninstead. Here, we propose a graph-based communicative message passing neural\nnetwork (CMPNN) algorithm that can predict both the peak positions and absolute\nintensities corresponding to density functional theory (DFT) calculated molar\nabsorptivities in the IR domain. By modifying existing spectral loss functions,\nwe show that our method is able to predict with DFT-accuracy level the IR molar\nabsorptivities of a series of hydrocarbons containing up to ten carbon atoms\nand apply the model to a set of larger molecules. We also compare the predicted\nspectra with those generated by the direct message passing neural network\n(DMPNN).

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view\ngraph-tuple framework. Instead of a single graph, our graph-tuple framework\npartitions the graph into disjoint subgraphs, capturing primary local\ninteractions and weaker, long-range connections. We then learn multi-view\nrepresentations from the graph-tuple via a heterogeneous message-passing\narchitecture inspired by the theory of non-commuting operators, which we\nformally prove is strictly more expressive and guarantees a lower oracle risk\ncompared to single-graph message-passing models. We instantiate our framework\non two scientific domains: molecular property prediction from feature-scarce\nCoulomb matrices and cosmological parameter inference from geometric point\nclouds.

SEAL decomposes input graphs into chemically relevant fragments and\nestimates their causal influence on the output. The strong alignment between\nfragment contributions and model predictions is achieved by explicitly reducing\ninter-fragment message passing in our proposed model architecture. Extensive\nevaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world molecular datasets\ndemonstrate that SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in both\nquantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user\nstudy further confirms that SEAL provides more intuitive and trustworthy\nexplanations to domain experts. By bridging the gap between predictive\nperformance and interpretability, SEAL offers a promising direction for more\ntransparent and actionable molecular modeling.",

Current solutions have fundamental limitations: extending cutoff\nradii causes computational costs to scale cubically with distance;\nphysics-inspired kernels (e.g., Coulomb, dispersion) are often system-specific\nand lack generality; Fourier-space methods require careful tuning of multiple\nparameters (e.g., mesh size, k-space cutoff) with added computational overhead.\nWe introduce Multi-stage Clustered Global Modeling (MCGM), a lightweight,\nplug-and-play module that endows geometric GNNs with hierarchical global\ncontext through efficient clustering operations. MCGM builds a multi-resolution\nhierarchy of atomic clusters, distills global information via dynamic\nhierarchical clustering, and propagates this context back through learned\ntransformations, ultimately reinforcing atomic features via residual\nconnections. Seamlessly integrated into four diverse backbone architectures,\nMCGM reduces OE62 energy prediction error by an average of 26.2%. On AQM, MCGM\nachieves state-of-the-art accuracy (17.0 meV for energy, 4.9 meV/{\\AA} for\nforces) while using 20% fewer parameters than Neural P3M. Code will be made\navailable upon acceptance."

      "text": "We propose a machine learning (ML) architecture to better capture the\ndependency of thermodynamic properties on the independent states. When\npredicting state-dependent thermodynamic properties, ML models need to account\nfor both molecular structure and the thermodynamic state, described by\nindependent variables, typically temperature, pressure, and composition. Modern\nmolecular ML models typically include state information by adding it to\nmolecular fingerprint vectors or by embedding explicit (semi-empirical)\nthermodynamic relations. Here, we propose to rather split the information\nprocessing on the molecular structure and the dependency on states into two\nseparate network channels: a graph neural network and a multilayer perceptron,\nwhose output is combined by a dot product. We refer to our approach as\nDeepEOSNet, as this idea is based on the DeepONet architecture [Lu et al.\n(2021), Nat. Mach. Intell.]: instead of operators, we learn state dependencies,\nwith the possibility to predict equation of states (EOS). We investigate the\npredictive performance of DeepEOSNet by means of three case studies, which\ninclude the prediction of vapor pressure as a function of temperature, and\nmixture molar volume as a function of composition, temperature, and pressure.\nOur results show superior performance of DeepEOSNet for predicting vapor\npressure and comparable performance for predicting mixture molar volume\ncompared to state-of-research graph-based thermodynamic prediction models from\nour earlier works. In fact, we see large potential of DeepEOSNet in cases where\ndata is sparse in the state domain and the output function is structurally\nsimilar across different molecules. The concept of DeepEOSNet can easily be\ntransferred to other ML architectures in molecular context, and thus provides a\nviable option for property prediction."

      "text": "The enzyme turnover rate is a fundamental parameter in enzyme kinetics,\nreflecting the catalytic efficiency of enzymes. However, enzyme turnover rates\nremain scarce across most organisms due to the high cost and complexity of\nexperimental measurements. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal\nframework for predicting the enzyme turnover rate by integrating enzyme\nsequences, substrate structures, and environmental factors. Our model combines\na pre-trained language model and a convolutional neural network to extract\nfeatures from protein sequences, while a graph neural network captures\ninformative representations from substrate molecules. An attention mechanism is\nincorporated to enhance interactions between enzyme and substrate\nrepresentations. Furthermore, we leverage symbolic regression via\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks to explicitly learn mathematical formulas that\ngovern the enzyme turnover rate, enabling interpretable and accurate\npredictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms\nboth traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. This work\nprovides a robust tool for studying enzyme kinetics and holds promise for\napplications in enzyme engineering, biotechnology, and industrial biocatalysis."

          "text": "We propose a machine learning (ML) architecture to better capture the\ndependency of thermodynamic properties on the independent states. When\npredicting state-dependent thermodynamic properties, ML models need to account\nfor both molecular structure and the thermodynamic state, described by\nindependent variables, typically temperature, pressure, and composition. Modern\nmolecular ML models typically include state information by adding it to\nmolecular fingerprint vectors or by embedding explicit (semi-empirical)\nthermodynamic relations. Here, we propose to rather split the information\nprocessing on the molecular structure and the dependency on states into two\nseparate network channels: a graph neural network and a multilayer perceptron,\nwhose output is combined by a dot product. We refer to our approach as\nDeepEOSNet, as this idea is based on the DeepONet architecture [Lu et al.\n(2021), Nat. Mach. Intell.]: instead of operators, we learn state dependencies,\nwith the possibility to predict equation of states (EOS). We investigate the\npredictive performance of DeepEOSNet by means of three case studies, which\ninclude the prediction of vapor pressure as a function of temperature, and\nmixture molar volume as a function of composition, temperature, and pressure.\nOur results show superior performance of DeepEOSNet for predicting vapor\npressure and comparable performance for predicting mixture molar volume\ncompared to state-of-research graph-based thermodynamic prediction models from\nour earlier works. In fact, we see large potential of DeepEOSNet in cases where\ndata is sparse in the state domain and the output function is structurally\nsimilar across different molecules. The concept of DeepEOSNet can easily be\ntransferred to other ML architectures in molecular context, and thus provides a\nviable option for property prediction.",

Attention helps prioritize important edges/features during local aggregation.\n- Incorporate spatial / 3D information when available\n  - Using geometric information or 3D conformers boosts performance; hybrid architectures that fuse 2D topology and 3D conformers (e.g., ego-net ensembles) produce strong pretrained representations [arxiv:2509.22468v1]. Spatial features were found beneficial in many datasets, though impact varies by dataset diversity [arxiv:2509.10871v1].\n- Add global-context modules to counter locality bias\n  - Hierarchical global-context mechanisms (e.g., Multi-stage Clustered Global Modeling, MCGM) provide long-range interactions efficiently and substantially reduce energy-prediction error across backbones, addressing the message-passing locality limitation [arxiv:2509.22028v1].\n- Keep models simple where possible\n  - Simpler MPNN formulations (minimalist messages, exclusion of self-perception) combined with attention often match or exceed more complex alternatives—suggesting careful parsimony and feature design can beat complexity [arxiv:2509.10871v1].\n- Hybrid backbones and contrast-free pretraining\n  - Combining GNN encoders with Transformer-style components and contrast-free objectives (predicting complementary subgraph embeddings across conformers) yields strong generalizable representations without heavy augmentation or negative sampling [arxiv:2509.22468v1].\n\n2) Dataset gaps and limitations\n- Limited labeled data and conformational coverage\n  - Large labeled datasets remain scarce; methods that exploit GEOM-style conformer ensembles for pretraining help but many downstream datasets lack rich 3D conformational diversity [arxiv:2509.22468v1].\n- Structural diversity varies across benchmarks\n  - Performance benefits from added components (3D features, attention) depend on dataset structural diversity—some benchmarks are homogeneous and do not require complex spatial modeling [arxiv:2509.10871v1].\n- Domain-specific physics/data scarcity\n  - Physics-inspired kernels (Coulomb, dispersion) are often system-specific and not generally usable",

When\npredicting state-dependent thermodynamic properties, ML models need to account\nfor both molecular structure and the thermodynamic state, described by\nindependent variables, typically temperature, pressure, and composition. Modern\nmolecular ML models typically include state information by adding it to\nmolecular fingerprint vectors or by embedding explicit (semi-empirical)\nthermodynamic relations. Here, we propose to rather split the information\nprocessing on the molecular structure and the dependency on states into two\nseparate network channels: a graph neural network and a multilayer perceptron,\nwhose output is combined by a dot product. We refer to our approach as\nDeepEOSNet, as this idea is based on the DeepONet architecture [Lu et al.\n(2021), Nat. Mach. Intell.]: instead of operators, we learn state dependencies,\nwith the possibility to predict equation of states (EOS). We investigate the\npredictive performance of DeepEOSNet by means of three case studies, which\ninclude the prediction of vapor pressure as a function of temperature, and\nmixture molar volume as a function of composition, temperature, and pressure.\nOur results show superior performance of DeepEOSNet for predicting vapor\npressure and comparable performance for predicting mixture molar volume\ncompared to state-of-research graph-based thermodynamic prediction models from\nour earlier works. In fact, we see large potential of DeepEOSNet in cases where\ndata is sparse in the state domain and the output function is structurally\nsimilar across different molecules.

Evaluated on 58 benchmark datasets from Polaris and\nMoleculeACE, CheMeleon achieves a win rate of 79% on Polaris tasks,\noutperforming baselines like Random Forest (46%), fastprop (39%), and Chemprop\n(36%), and a 97% win rate on MoleculeACE assays, surpassing Random Forest (63%)\nand other foundation models. However, it struggles to distinguish activity\ncliffs like many of the tested models. The t-SNE projection of CheMeleon's\nlearned representations demonstrates effective separation of chemical series,\nhighlighting its ability to capture structural nuances. These results\nunderscore the potential of descriptor-based pre-training for scalable and\neffective molecular property prediction, opening avenues for further\nexploration of descriptor sets and unlabeled datasets.",

MCGM builds a multi-resolution\nhierarchy of atomic clusters, distills global information via dynamic\nhierarchical clustering, and propagates this context back through learned\ntransformations, ultimately reinforcing atomic features via residual\nconnections. Seamlessly integrated into four diverse backbone architectures,\nMCGM reduces OE62 energy prediction error by an average of 26.2%. On AQM, MCGM\nachieves state-of-the-art accuracy (17.0 meV for energy, 4.9 meV/{\\AA} for\nforces) while using 20% fewer parameters than Neural P3M. Code will be made\navailable upon acceptance.",

Unlike conventional\napproaches relying on noisy experimental data or biased quantum mechanical\nsimulations, CheMeleon uses low-noise molecular descriptors to learn rich\nmolecular representations.

However, it struggles to distinguish activity\ncliffs like many of the tested models. The t-SNE projection of CheMeleon's\nlearned representations demonstrates effective separation of chemical series,\nhighlighting its ability to capture structural nuances.
